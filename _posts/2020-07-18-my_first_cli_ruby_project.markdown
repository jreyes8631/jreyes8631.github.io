The past two weeks have been a hunt for the right API. At the beginning of my journey, I was looking for a shopping list API because I already had my code for a shopping list app. I found the RapidAPI webpage were I manage to find an API that fit my needs. According to the program, I had already written.

I spend hours trying to understand what I was going to do with it. I had two questions in my head: How can I start this? And, is this going to work?.  I felt overwhelmed because the API I have chosen had a lot of information. The API documentation wasn't the best, at least for a free user like me.  After I read a lot from the RapidAPI I found an API that was simple enough that I could work with it. Because of the new information, I have now I made the decision to create a new Repo from scratch, with a new name and new code.

Now, with the help of my lead and some other students like me, I manage to create the RecipeApp. This interactive app will give you some Recipes ideas by looking for ingredients, names of any dish you already now, or any food-related products.  After you type what you like to search for it will give you a list of dishes where you can choose to see more information about for that recipe you choose.

I hope that in time and with more skills added to my skill set I can go back and make it a lot better. it has been really fun and frustrating at the same time working in this project. Something that I can add is that I'm grateful that flatiron school is giving me the opportunity to become a software engineer.
