I don't have enough words to explain how tough this project was for me. Back when I started on mod 1. I thought ruby was going to be the doom of me. But with time and dedication, I was able to understand and work with it.  Mod 2 Sinatra was a little confusing sometimes, but since I had a plan it all worked in the end. Then I hear that reails was going to be the real challenge, even though I face some issues I felt comfortable and completed my project in a few days.  Then Javascript happened. It is here
and I didn't have a plan, an idea, or where to start.

Hopefully, for me, my cohort lead is a great guy with a bright mind.
we started working together on an idea where I could do my best. I was worried that with the knowledge I had at the time I was not going to be able to create something with javascript. I felt like back to mod 1 seeing something new for the first time.

I had some personal issues and couldn't start my project in the first project week. I had some issues with the initial idea of making a playlist app, so I decided to make an inventory tracking app.  I started working on my backend and for some reason when I ran the code to build it API only it didn't work.

```
rails new rails-inventory-backend -–api -–database=postgresql -T
```
The code above created a new rails application, however, it was a mix between API and web service. it gave me so much error with using the fetch request from javascript and created some issues in my database. Then I use the following code.

```
rails new rails-inventory-backend -–api  -T
```
This one did work and I was able to finish a functional backend on time. if you ever need help with this I'm leaving the link to the guide.

I hope this is helpful if anyone else encounters the same issue.
