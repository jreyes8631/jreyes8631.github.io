Back in 2012, I started working for **Theorem Creations** an advertising company.
My role started as a Quality assurance analyst assistance, with no experience in software development. 

I didn't know that I will find my new passion at this company and with it a lot of new friends. I was trained to test the functionality of applications. I was thought to break the application or the ad that I was testing. first came FLASH, ADOBE PHOTOSHOP, ILLUSTRATOR, HTML, and CSS. I was working with companies like Google, Youtube, Facebook, Mediamind, etc. Doing cross-browser testing and versa-tag testing.

All my other friends in the company were developers and this was the first time that I was seeing behind the curtains. I felt in love with programming.  My friends and other coworkers were happy and I wanted to be that while working too.
I was happy being part of the team but I wanted to be the one who creates things.

This company name now is THEOREM LLC and is located here in the USA while I was working from the Dominican Republic.  After my experience with programming, I decided that I wanted to be a Software engineer.
